pv - WebGL protein viewer
=========================================

pv  is a WebGL-based protein viewer whose goal is to once-for-all end the reign of Java applets on websites that require visualisation of protein structures. It implements all major render modes that you would expect. It is growing more limbs on a weekly basis.

It has been implemented with maximum performance in mind. There is nothing worse than an unresponsive website.


Trying it out
-----------------------------------------

Clone this repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/biasmv/pv.git
```

Change to the pv directory and serve the files. This is required for the demo to work properly.

```
$ cd pv
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Open a WebGL-enabled web browser and visit http://localhost:8000
